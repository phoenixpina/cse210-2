    To be inherited
    can turn on and off using a user command
        user types "on" or "off" - switch case? Maybe instead just "1" or "2"?
    Can display to the user if it is on or off
        option in switch case to display it?
    Tells you how long it's been on for
        I really dont have any ideas atm
