//Man, I scrapped a fair amount of ideas I wanted to do with this.
//I wanted to have a level up system, I wanted items to go to the player's inventory
//so the player could choose to eat food mid battle, I wanted there to be 3 areas
//and have each of the 3 rarities of enemies spawn in their respective areas instead of what the game now is.
//But that's just how it goes, I guess.

//Also I don't think the saving and loading works properly.
