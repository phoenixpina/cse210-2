This is a simple text-based game that runs in the terminal. It is based on the Fallout series.
The instructions are simple and are given at the start of the program.

Not everything I wanted to be in it got implemented. But what's in it works- except for saving and loading.
Should you select "2" on the menu, which is save game, an error will occur, but I don't really have time to
figure out how to fix it.

I wanted to have a level up system, I wanted items to go to the player's inventory so the player could choose 
to eat food mid battle (instead now there's only 2 options mid battle), and I wanted there to be 3 areas
and have each of the 3 rarities of enemies spawn in their respective areas instead of just the one area.
But that's just how it goes, I guess. There's some areas with commented out code, all of that is leftover code
from the described scrapped features above.

And good luck killing the Behemoth should you attempt, I myself didn't have the patience to go through the RNG of having 
enough health to fight it and win. Speaking of which, I wanted the player health to be capped (how it currently is,
food allows your health to exceed what the max should be), but in the end, it wasn't such a big deal gameplay-wise.
